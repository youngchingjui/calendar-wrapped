# Feature: Event Search and Filtering

## Overview

The goal is to introduce a comprehensive search and filtering functionality within the Calendar Wrapped app. This feature will allow users to:

- Review all their events to ensure data accuracy.
- Perform advanced searches to find detailed information about specific events.
- Filter events by keywords to identify patterns or specific types of events (e.g., “flights”).

By implementing this feature, we aim to enhance user engagement and provide a more personalized experience.

## Objectives

- **Confidence**: Users are confident the app loaded their data correctly
- **Utility**: App becomes more useful, increasing # of times opened

## User Stories

1. **Event Review** - As a user, I want to see a list of all my events so that I can verify that all my calendar data is properly loaded into the app.
2. **Keyword Search** - As a user, I want to search for events by keyword so that I can quickly find specific events (e.g., all “flights” I took this year).
3. **Advanced Filtering** - As a user, I want to filter events based on criteria like date range, attendees, or location to find events that match specific conditions.
4. **Event Details Exploration** - As a user, I want to access detailed information about specific events directly from the search results.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Search Interface**

   - Implement a search bar accessible from a dedicated search page.
   - The search bar should allow for both simple keyword searches and advanced filtering options.

2. **Keyword Search Functionality**

   - Enable users to search events by keywords found in:
     - Event titles
     - Event descriptions
     - Locations
     - Attendee names or emails
   - Support partial matches and case-insensitive searches.

3. **Advanced Filtering Options**

   - **Date Range Filter**: Allow users to specify start and end dates.
   - **Attendees Filter**: Search for events with specific attendees.
   - **Location Filter**: Filter events based on location names or addresses.
   - **Event Type Filter**: Categorize events (e.g., meetings, flights, conferences) and allow filtering by type.

4. **Search Results Display**

   - Show a list of events matching the search criteria.
   - Display key event details:
     - Title
     - Date and time
     - Location
     - Attendees
   - Allow users to sort results by date, relevance, or other criteria.
   - Enable users to click on an event to view full details.

5. **Usability Features**

   - **Real-Time Results**: Update search results dynamically as users type.
   - **Clear Search**: Provide an option to quickly clear search inputs and filters.
   - **No Results Handling**: Display a friendly message and suggestions when no events match the search criteria.

6. **Performance Optimization**

   - Ensure that the search feature is responsive and performs efficiently even with large datasets.

7. **User Interface and Experience**

   - Design the search interface to be intuitive and align with the app’s overall aesthetic.
   - Ensure that advanced filtering options are accessible but do not overwhelm users.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**

   - Search queries should return results within 1 second.
   - The interface should remain responsive during searches.

2. **Scalability**

   - The search functionality should handle large volumes of events without degradation in performance.

3. **Security and Privacy**

   - Ensure that sensitive event information is protected.
   - Comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

4. **Accessibility**

   - Design the search interface to be accessible to users with disabilities.
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility.

5. **Compatibility**

   - The search feature should function consistently across all supported devices and operating systems.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Data Handling**

   - Index event data to optimize search performance.
   - Implement debouncing to prevent excessive queries during typing.

2. **State Management**

   - Use efficient state management to handle search inputs and results.
   - Ensure that search states persist appropriately when navigating through the app.

3. **Testing**

   - Write unit tests for search functions.
   - Perform integration tests to ensure compatibility with existing features.

## Design Considerations

- **Placement**: Decide whether the search bar should be on the main page, in a sidebar, or on a separate search page.
- **Discoverability**: Ensure that users can easily find and understand how to use the search feature.
- **Visual Clarity**: Use icons and labels to make the search and filter options clear.

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Overcomplicating the UI with too many options.

- **Mitigation**: Start with basic search functionality and progressively enhance it based on user feedback.

2. **Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets.

- **Mitigation**: Optimize data structures and algorithms; consider implementing server-side search if necessary.

3. **Risk**: Users may not understand advanced filters.

- **Mitigation**: Provide tooltips or brief explanations for advanced options; design the UI to be intuitive.

Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: Track how often users utilize the search feature.
- **Search Efficiency**: Measure the average time users take to find specific events.
- **User Satisfaction**: Collect user feedback through surveys or app ratings regarding the search functionality.

Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Planning and Design

- **User Research**: Gather more insights into user needs and behaviors related to event searching.
- **Design Mockups**: Create UI/UX designs for the search interface and filtering options.
- **Feedback Loop**: Present designs to stakeholders and select users for feedback.

2. Phase 2: Development

- **Basic Search Implementation**:
  - Develop the search bar and basic keyword search functionality.
- **Advanced Filters**:
  - Implement additional filtering options (date range, attendees, location).
- **Results Display**:
- Design and develop the search results interface.

3. Phase 3: Testing

- **Functional Testing**: Ensure all search features work as intended.
- **Performance Testing**: Test search speed and responsiveness with varying dataset sizes.
- **Usability Testing**: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the search experience.

4. Phase 4: Deployment

- **Beta Release**: Roll out the search feature to a small user group.
- **Monitor and Iterate**: Collect data on usage and issues; make necessary adjustments.
- **Full Release**: Deploy the feature to all users once it meets quality standards.

5. **Phase 5: Post-Launch**

- **Support and Maintenance**: Monitor for bugs or performance issues.
- **User Education**: Provide tutorials or tips within the app to help users utilize the search feature effectively.

## Open Questions

- **Integration with Other Features**:
  - How will the search feature interact with the existing cards that showcase yearly highlights?
  - Should search results influence the content displayed in these cards?
- **Natural Language Processing**:
  - Is there a need for natural language search capabilities (e.g., “Show me all meetings with John in June”)?
- **Offline Support**:
  - Will the search functionality be available offline, or is an internet connection required?
