# Feature: Event List with Search and Filtering

## Overview

The goal is to introduce a dedicated page within the Calendar Wrapped app that displays all the user's loaded events. This page will allow users to:

- **View All Events**: Provide a comprehensive list of all events loaded into the app, giving users confidence that their data is accurately represented.
- **Search and Filter Events**: Enable users to perform advanced searches and apply filters to find specific events or identify patterns (e.g., all “flights” taken this year).
- **Explore Event Details**: Allow users to access detailed information about specific events directly from the event list.

By implementing this feature, we aim to enhance user engagement, provide transparency, and offer a more personalized experience within the app.

## Objectives

- **Transparency**: Users can easily see all their events to verify data accuracy.
- **Utility**: Enhance the app's usefulness, encouraging users to open it more frequently.
- **User Engagement**: Increase interaction by allowing users to explore their event history in detail.

## User Stories

1. **Event List Viewing**  
   As a user, I want to see a list of all my events so that I can verify that my calendar data is properly loaded into the app.

2. **Keyword Search within Event List**  
   As a user, I want to search for events by keyword within the event list so that I can quickly find specific events (e.g., all “flights” I took this year).

3. **Advanced Filtering on Event List**  
   As a user, I want to filter the events displayed based on criteria like date range, attendees, or location to find events that match specific conditions.

4. **Event Details Exploration**  
   As a user, I want to access detailed information about specific events directly from the event list.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Event List Page**

   - Implement a dedicated page that displays all loaded events in a list or table format.
   - Ensure the event list is scrollable and efficiently handles large numbers of events.

2. **Search Interface**

   - Integrate a search bar on the event list page.
   - Allow for simple keyword searches and advanced filtering options.

3. **Keyword Search Functionality**

   - Enable users to search events by keywords found in:
     - Event titles
     - Event descriptions
     - Locations
     - Attendee names or emails
   - Support partial matches and case-insensitive searches.

4. **Advanced Filtering Options**

   - **Date Range Filter**: Allow users to specify start and end dates.
   - **Attendees Filter**: Filter events with specific attendees.
   - **Location Filter**: Filter events based on location names or addresses.
   - **Event Type Filter**: Categorize events (e.g., meetings, flights, conferences) and allow filtering by type.

5. **Event Details Display**

   - Show key event details in the list:
     - Title
     - Date and time
     - Location
     - Attendees
   - Enable users to click on an event to view full details on a separate page or modal.

6. **Usability Features**

   - **Real-Time Results**: Update the event list dynamically as users type or adjust filters.
   - **Clear Search and Filters**: Provide options to quickly clear search inputs and reset filters.
   - **No Results Handling**: Display a friendly message and suggestions when no events match the search criteria.

7. **Performance Optimization**

   - Ensure the event list loads quickly and remains responsive during searches and filtering.
   - Implement efficient data handling to support large datasets.

8. **User Interface and Experience**

   - Design the event list page to align with the app’s overall aesthetic using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
   - Ensure advanced filtering options are accessible but not overwhelming, possibly using collapsible sections or modals.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**

   - The event list and search functionality should respond within 1 second.
   - Smooth scrolling and navigation through the event list.

2. **Scalability**

   - Must handle large volumes of events without performance degradation.

3. **Security and Privacy**

   - Protect sensitive event information.
   - Comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).

4. **Accessibility**

   - Design the interface to be accessible to users with disabilities.
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

5. **Compatibility**

   - Ensure consistent functionality across all supported devices and browsers.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Data Handling**

   - Optimize data retrieval and storage of events to minimize load times.
   - Implement indexing and efficient algorithms for searching and filtering.

2. **State Management**

   - Utilize an efficient state management solution to handle the event list, search inputs, and filters.
   - Ensure state persistence when navigating away and returning to the event list page.

3. **Testing**

   - Write unit tests for event list rendering and search/filter functions.
   - Conduct integration tests to ensure smooth interaction with existing features.

## Design Considerations

- **Layout**

  - Use a clean and intuitive layout for the event list, possibly with sortable columns.
  - Ensure that the design is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

- **Discoverability**

  - Make the search bar and filter options prominent and easily accessible.
  - Use placeholders and tooltips to guide users on how to use the search and filters.

- **Visual Clarity**

  - Use consistent icons and labels for actions like search, filter, and clear.
  - Highlight search terms within the event list results.

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Risk**: Overcomplicating the UI with too many options.

   - **Mitigation**: Start with essential features and gather user feedback before adding more options.

2. **Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets.

   - **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading, virtualization, and efficient data structures.

3. **Risk**: Users may find the event list overwhelming.

   - **Mitigation**: Provide options to group events (e.g., by date or category) and collapse sections.

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: Track the usage frequency of the event list page and search features.
- **Search Efficiency**: Measure the average time users take to find specific events.
- **User Satisfaction**: Collect feedback on the usefulness and usability of the event list and search functionality.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Planning and Design**

   - **User Research**: Understand how users prefer to view and interact with event lists.
   - **Design Mockups**: Create UI/UX designs for the event list page with integrated search and filtering.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Review designs with stakeholders and potential users.

2. **Phase 2: Development**

   - **Event List Page**:
     - Develop the page to display all events using Next.js and React Server Components.
   - **Search and Filter Functionality**:
     - Implement the search bar and advanced filtering options.
   - **Event Details Integration**:
     - Enable navigation from events in the list to detailed views.

3. **Phase 3: Testing**

   - **Functional Testing**: Verify all features work as expected.
   - **Performance Testing**: Assess load times and responsiveness with large numbers of events.
   - **Usability Testing**: Gather user feedback on the event list experience.

4. **Phase 4: Deployment**

   - **Beta Release**: Introduce the feature to a select user group.
   - **Monitor and Iterate**: Use analytics and feedback to make improvements.

## Open Questions

- **Event Grouping**:

  - Should events be grouped by date, category, or other criteria for better organization?

- **Integration with Highlights**:

  - How will the event list interact with the existing highlight cards? Can users navigate between them seamlessly?

- **Pagination vs. Infinite Scroll**:

  - Should the event list use pagination, infinite scrolling, or a "Load More" button for better performance and usability?

- **Customization**:
  - Will users have the ability to customize which columns or information are displayed in the event list?
