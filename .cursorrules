## Context about this application

This NextJS application will let people view a summary of their calendar, like "Spotify Wrapped" for their calendar.

They will connect to their Google Calendar, and we will use the Google Calendar API to fetch their events.

Then, we will use the events to generate a summary of their calendar.

## User stories

## Acceptance criteria
